## Current version:  
Agents need to eat to stay alive. Agents colors represent their social value orientation (selfish, altruistic, sadistic...) 

  Agents can: 
  + move around the grid
  + eat food
  + trade food for seeds at the trading stations
  + plant the seeds on the soil
  + push agents away
  + give agents food

  #### Plants:
  + Plants now take time to grow  
  + they start off as seeds and get bigger with time (4 sizes possible)   
  + you can see how "big" the plant is by the number of leaves (1 leaf = 1 unit of food for agents)

## Context

### SVO
Social value orientation (SVO) is a measure that corresponds to a combination of weights an individual places on it's own outcome vs others outcome when making a decision.
